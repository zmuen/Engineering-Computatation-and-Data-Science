## Instruction
You need to develop a reaction timer app to test reaction times and record the fastest. You will need a server that serves up a web page.  Think through how the timer is “fair”. Consider how to deal with someone who rapidly keeps clicking, or uses some other mechanism to “cheat” your system. 
I suggest you start with a very simple system with say one button that changes color after some random time between 1 and 20 seconds. Think through how you will transmit the timing from the web page to the server and record it there.
